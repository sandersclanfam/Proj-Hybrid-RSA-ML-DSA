# Security Policy for TQ42 Cryptography

## Introduction

This document outlines the security processes and policies for the TQ42 Cryptography. Our aim is to maintain the highest security standards in post-quantum cryptographic development and to be transparent about our security practices. We encourage responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security bugs in TQ42 Cryptography seriously. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. Please open a [new issue](https://github.com/terra-quantum-public/tq42-pqc-oss/security/advisories/new) and clearly document the specifics of the vulnerability.


### Response Expectations

Upon receipt of a vulnerability issue, the following actions will be taken:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report.
- We will perform an initial analysis to verify the validity of the report.
- Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will schedule a fix to be implemented.
- We will publicly announce the vulnerability after the fix and release, respecting confidentiality agreements where applicable.

## Security Updates Policy

- Security updates will be issued as part of regular library updates.
- Emergency updates will be triggered by critical vulnerability discoveries that directly impact the usability and integrity of cryptographic modules.

## Known Security Gaps & Future Enhancements

As with any cryptographic library, there may be undiscovered vulnerabilities. The field of post-quantum cryptography is rapidly evolving, and TQ42 Cryptography is committed to integrating robust and innovative security practices as the landscape evolves.

## Resolved Issues

As of the current date, there have been no security issues reported.
