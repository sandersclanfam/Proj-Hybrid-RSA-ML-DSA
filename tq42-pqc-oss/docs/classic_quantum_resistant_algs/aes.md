AES-256 is a variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm that uses a 256-bit key length. It is one of the most secure encryption methods and is often used in government and industry applications. AES operates on a fixed block size of 128 bits and with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, but in the case of AES-256, the key size as mentioned is 256 bits.

The encryption modes are methods that describe how to repeatedly apply the cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block. Different modes are used for different applications, offering various levels of security and efficiency based on the use case.

*  **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**: This is the simplest encryption mode. Each block of plaintext is encrypted separately. This can lead to patterns in the ciphertext when identical blocks of plaintext are encrypted, making ECB susceptible to certain attacks (e.g., pattern analysis).
    
*  **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**: CBC mode adds an initialization vector (IV) to the first data block before the encryption process starts. Each subsequent block of plaintext is XORed (exclusive OR) with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means that identical plain text blocks will produce different ciphertext blocks. The IV ensures that even if the same message is encrypted multiple times, it will result in different ciphertexts.
    
*  **Output Feedback (OFB)**: OFB converts a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher. It generates keystream blocks, which are then XORed with the plaintext blocks to produce ciphertext. The same keystream blocks are used to decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext. OFB ensures that the same plaintext inputs will result in different ciphertext outputs.
    
* **Counter (CTR)**: Like OFB, CTR turns a block cipher into a stream cipher. It encrypts a set of counter values and then XORs the resulting output with the plaintext to generate the ciphertext. The counter is increased by one for every subsequent block and must be unique for each encryption operation. CTR mode is known for its ability to allow random access to the encrypted data blocks.

* **Galois/Counter (GCM)**: The GCM algorithm provides both data authenticity (integrity) and confidentiality and belongs to the class of authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) methods. This means that as input it takes a key K, some plaintext P, and some associated data AD; it then encrypts the plaintext using the key to produce ciphertext C, and computes an authentication tag T from the ciphertext and the associated data (which remains unencrypted). A recipient with knowledge of K, upon reception of AD, C and T, can decrypt the ciphertext to recover the plaintext P and can check the tag T to ensure that neither ciphertext nor associated data were tampered with.    

Each of these modes has a specific use case where it excels and others where it may be susceptible. Modern practices typically favor modes like CTR over ECB and CBC due to their stronger security properties and performance benefits, particularly in settings susceptible to parallel processing.

Quantum resistance
------------------

AES-256 is considered to be [quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) resistant, as it has similar quantum resistance to AES-128's resistance against traditional, non-quantum, attacks at 128 [bits of security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bits_of_security). AES-192 and AES-128 are not considered quantum resistant due to their smaller key sizes. AES-192 has a strength of 96 bits against quantum attacks and AES-128 has 64 bits of strength against quantum attacks, making them both insecure.

NIST

The NIST certification for AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) refers to the validation process overseen by the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), which is part of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). AES itself, specified under the publication FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) 197, is an encryption standard approved by NIST in 2001 for securing sensitive but unclassified material by U.S. government agencies and, by extension, for other organizations.
