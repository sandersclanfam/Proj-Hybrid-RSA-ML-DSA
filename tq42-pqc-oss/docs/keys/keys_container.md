**Key Containers** are secure storage locations where cryptographic keys are held. These keys are used for various security purposes such as encrypting and decrypting data, digital signing, and authentication. Key containers help maintain the integrity and confidentiality of these keys, ensuring they are protected from unauthorized access.

NIST
-----
Key Containers, developed by Terra Quantum, adhere to the comprehensive NIST guidelines specified in the:
- [NIST Key Management Guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/key-management/key-management-guidelines) 
- [Recommendation for Key Management](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5.pdf)

These guidelines encompass best practices for the management of cryptographic keying material, including general guidance and minimum requirements for federal information systems, aimed at ensuring robust and secure key management.

Key Containers Features
------------------------------

-   **Minimize exposure**: Terra Quantum Key Containers follow best practices by limiting the time secret symmetric or asymmetric private keys remain in plaintext form to reduce the risk of exposure.
-   **Enhance confidentiality**: These containers prevent direct human access to plaintext secret keys, ensuring that keys are not viewed unintentionally or maliciously.
-   **Confirm key correctness**: Key confirmation protocols such as those outlined in SP 800-175B, SP 800-56A, and SP 800-56B are employed to verify the correct establishment of keys, enhancing security.
-   **Verify key integrity**: Terra Quantum Key Containers incorporate cryptographic integrity checks, like Message Authentication Codes (MAC) or digital signatures, to validate a key's integrity and prevent tampering.

Symmetric & Asymmetric Key Containers Distinction
---------------------------------
Please be aware that symmetric and asymmetric containers are stored in separate vectors and must not be confused with one another. Each type serves distinct cryptographic functions, yet they may share identical numerical identifiers. For example, a symmetric container and an asymmetric container could both be labeled with the number "N," but they are inherently different entities.

-   **Risk of Misuse**: Utilizing a function intended for symmetric containers on an asymmetric container (or vice versa) can result in undefined behavior, which might include data corruption, security breaches, or system crashes.



## Symmetric Key Container

### `PQC_symmetric_container_create`
**Function signature:**
```cpp
PQC_CONTAINER_HANDLE PQC_symmetric_container_create(CIPHER_HANDLE handle);
```
-   The function that is used to create a Symmetric Key Container.
-   This function returns a handle, denoted as  `PQC_CONTAINER_HANDLE`, which serves as a reference to the newly created container within the program's memory.

**Parameters**
*	`handle`: The encryption context handle. This is used to provide random source for container creation. Use `PQC_container_create_randomsource` to create context for a sole purpose of generating random numbers.

**Initialization with Random Keys**:
When the container is created, it fetches keys from a selected randomness source. This step ensures that the keys generated for the container are sufficiently random and secure for cryptographic operations.
    
**File Association Clarification**:
 It's important to note that upon creation, the new container is not automatically linked to a file on disk. This means that the container is purely in memory and needs to be saved explicitly to disk if persistent storage is required. This can be achieved using function  `PQC_symmetric_container_save_as()`.
 
**Handling Container Data**:
    If there is a need to work with the contents of the container, such as transferring it over a network or performing other operations, the data within the container can be extracted using a function like  `PQC_symmetric_container_get_data()`. This function retrieves the contents of the container in a suitable format for further processing or transmission.

### `PQC_symmetric_container_size`

**Function signature**:  
```cpp
size_t PQC_symmetric_container_size(PQC_CONTAINER_HANDLE container)     
```
- is designed to determine the size of the buffer needed to store the data extracted from the container.
- This step is crucial for ensuring that the buffer allocated for storing the container data is of the appropriate size to prevent data loss or truncation.

**Parameters**:
    
   - `container`: This parameter represents the handle of the container from which the data size is being queried. It serves as a reference to the specific container being processed.

**Return Value**:

   - This size value is essential for allocating a buffer with sufficient capacity to accommodate the extracted container data without loss or overflow.

### `PQC_symmetric_container_get_version`

**Function signature**:  
```cpp
uint32_t PQC_symmetric_container_get_version(PQC_CONTAINER_HANDLE container)
```
- is designed to determine the container version.

The provided code snippet outlines a function designed to close a container when it's no longer in use.

Here's a breakdown of the function and its relevant components:

### `PQC_symmetric_container_close`
**Function signature:**    
```cpp
PQC_symmetric_container_close(PQC_CONTAINER_HANDLE container)
```
- This function is used to safely close a specified container, effectively releasing or finalizing resources associated with that container. Closing containers when they are no longer in use is a best practice that helps manage resources efficiently and ensures data integrity.

**Parameters:**

-   **`container`**: This parameter is the handle to the container that needs to be closed. The handle acts as a unique identifier for the container within the application or system, allowing the function to pinpoint which specific container to close.

**Return Values:**

-   **`PQC_OK`**: This return value indicates that the operation was successful, meaning the container was closed without any issues.
-   **`PQC_BAD_CONTAINER`**: This return value indicates an invalid container handle was provided, which means the function failed to find or recognize the specified container, and therefore, could not close it. This could occur if the container handle is incorrect, has already been closed, or never existed.

### `PQC_symmetric_container_delete`
**Function signature:**    
```cpp
size_t PQC_API PQC_symmetric_container_delete(CIPHER_HANDLE handle, const char * filename)
```

- This function deletes a file with the specified name.

**Parameters**:
 - `handle`: The encryption context handle. This is used to provide random source for container creation. Use `PQC_container_create_randomsource` to create context for a sole purpose of generating random numbers.
- `filename`: A string representing the name of the file to be deleted.


**Return Values:**

-  **`PQC_OK`**: Indicates that the operation was successful.
-  **`PQC_IO_ERROR`**: Indicates that the operation was not performed due to an input/output error.
-  **PQC_RANDOM_FAILURE**: External random source returns error

-   `container`: Handle of the container where the keys will be inserted.
-   `sk`: Pointer to where the private key will be stored. The key format should match the chosen cipher:
    -   For  `PQC_CIPHER_FALCON`: Use  `pqc_falcon_private_key`  structure or a buffer of size  `PQC_FALCON_PRIVATE_KEYLEN`.
-   `pk`: Pointer to where the public key will be stored. The key format should match the chosen cipher:
    -   For  `PQC_CIPHER_FALCON`: Use  `pqc_falcon_public_key`  structure or a buffer of size  `PQC_FALCON_PUBLIC_KEYLEN`.
-   `pk_length`: Length of the public key.
