# Quantum Random Number Generator

TQ42 Cryptography can seamlessly integrate into the company security pipeline when paired with the proprietary Pseudo Key Generator PQ17. For enhanced security and a top-tier solution, clients have the option to engage with Terra Quantum to secure a license for integration with true randomness via the Single Photon Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), which is aligned with the latest NIST standard (SP 800-90B) and certified by METAS. This cutting-edge technology, a signature offering from Terra Quantum, embodies genuine quantum randomness, guaranteeing the generation of highly secure random numbers. The foundation of this unparalleled security lies in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The device operates on a true random entropy source, enabling swift and precise generation of random numbers at remarkable speed.
