/*
The hash taking mode SHAKE is the mode of the sha 3 hash function, but with a variable output size.
Simply put, you can take hash with any hash size.
The SHAKE function exists in two instances: SHAKE 128 and SHAKE 256. They differ somewhat in their internal
structure. In particular, SHAKE 256 will do more permutations with larger output hash sizes, which means it
will have higher reliability. However, this does not significantly affect the quality of hash functions. And
it has absolutely no effect on the interface to use.

In this example, we will create a message with data, take a hash from it and compare it with the default cache
that should be received.

    In detail. There is a function PQC_hash_update(). It allows you to add data to the buffer from which the hash is
    taken. It is important to understand that this function can be applied to one hash function object many times. That
    is, if you need to take a hash from data of this type "1234567890", then you can add "1234" first, and then
    additionally add "567890" and take the hash. And it won't be any different from taking the hash from "1234567890".
    Moreover, you can first add "1234", take the hash from this data, and then add "567890" and again take the hash from
    the added data. And the resulting hash will be equivalent to the hash from "1234567890".

    In the example, we will first add "1234", then we will take a hash from this data, show that it is NOT equal to our
    default message. Then add "567890", take the hash again. And show that it is equal to our default message. After
    that, we will create a new hash function object and take the hash from "1234567890". And let's show that it is also
    equal to our default message.
